Hello, My name is rubix4x4 and I'm a mechanical engineer PhD. My previous graudate research focussed on robotic systems for pediatric gait rehabilitation.

My recent work experience in simulation or robotic systems for industry purposes has opened my interests to simulation, path planning, trajectory optimizaiton, and machine learning applications.
