Hello, My name is rubix4x4 and I'm a recent mechanical engineer PhD. During my recent free time I have begun to teach myself python usage.

My training comes largely from the field of robotics, having done my graduate research on rehabilitation robotic system design and control. However my recent work experience in simulation has opened my interests to simulation, path planning, trajectory optimizaiton, and machine learning applications.
